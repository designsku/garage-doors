<p>The added weight of the insulation may effect the spring tension in your door. You can purchase garage doors with R-values of 12 or higher for increased insulation. You can use fiberglass rock wool or blown in cellulose insulation material. Garage door insulation significantly reduces the noise from passing traffic and also reduces the noise your garage door makes.
