Should be 110 to 120 volts from the breaker leg to the neutral ground if its a single pole breaker or 220 to 240 volts across the two breaker legs if its a two pole.

It can usually be found in the garage basement outside wall of the house and in older homes sometimes it will be located in a bathroom. As above my garage does not have power and is in a block of garages away from.</p>
