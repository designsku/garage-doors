<p>Locating this antenna wire outdoors should provide greater range because it delivers the signal through garage wall. Make a good electrical connection and either solder or secure with a wire nut. Simply extend the openers short antenna wire 10 20 or more feet toward the approaching vehicle. Right now the only light that I get is from a small 40w bulb built into the garage door opener.
