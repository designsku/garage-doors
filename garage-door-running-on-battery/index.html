Everyone gets busy and loses track of home or garage maintenance tasks at some point or another. I thought the battery contacts were touching a transistor or a capacitor so I moved it a bit so that wouldnt touch but its still happening. At this point the LED indicator will glow a solid orange showing that the door is running on battery power or a flashing orange meaning the battery is running low.
