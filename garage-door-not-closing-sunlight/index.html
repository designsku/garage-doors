<p>If you are having issues closing your garage door when there is a lot of sunlight shining into the garage you might need to check to see which safety sensor is in the sunlight. The sun light is so bright that the light cannot reach theother sensor. We purchased a garage door with keypad from Sears and have noticed that when the door itself is in the direct sunlight - late morning all the way until late afternoon you have to hold down the button on either the keypad or the button inside the garage by the door to the house until the garage door is all the way down - or else it will act like there is something in the way and start to close but then go. When the sun is shining brightly my garage door will not close. Eclipse Sun Shade Black 2 Door 07 16 Jeep Wrangler Jk Jeep Wrangler Jk Jeep Wrangler Accessories Four Door Jeep.</p>
