I had the same problem with my garage door in the morning the sun was shining directly at the sensor and the door could not close. If anything interrupts this beam of light the garage door will not close and the ceiling light on the opener mechanism will flash as mentioned in the previous step. When there is an issue with your safety sensors the opener will interpret this as an obstruction and refuse to close the door. A good way to see if this is whats wrong with your door is make sure nothing is blocking the door from closing and hold down the wall mounted button inside your garage. Most garage door openers have two adjustment knobs on them to set the motors torque when moving the door up or down.</p>

<p>Garage door wont close in the morning but closes at night just fine. It was worse for me because my garage door faces south and gets a lot of direct sunlight throughout the day. Shuts off all together loses power after repeated attempts to keep closing. On a properly functioning garage door there are springs in place to make the garage door close slowly instead of slamming down.
