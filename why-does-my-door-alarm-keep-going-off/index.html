<p>Weve had our fridgefreezer for 6 months and the door alarm keeps going off. If you recently removed the door for any reason be sure the wire harness is in place. If your Key fob is faulty for whatever reason it will result in incorrect signals being sent to the alarm system. A loose wire can also cause this problem.
